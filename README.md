# Accessible Static Website Project

This project was developed as part of a group assignment for the Web Engineering course. The goal was to create an accessible, responsive and sustainable static website using a Static Site Generator (SSG) and deploy it with automated workflows to a static hosting service.

The project uses **Eleventy (11ty)** as the SSG and **Netlify** as the hosting and deployment platform. All content is written in **Markdown** and transformed into semantic HTML. The layout uses **CSS Grid** for the page structure (header, main, footer) and **Flexbox** inside the main area to organise content and sidebar.

Accessibility (a11y), semantic HTML and sustainable design were key priorities. The final site is mobile-friendly, screen-reader compatible and tested on various screen sizes.

## HTML & CSS Validation

You can validate the site using the following tools:

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F<your-netlify-domain>)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2F<your-netlify-domain>&profile=css3svg)

> Replace `<your-netlify-domain>` with the actual deployed URL
